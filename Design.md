# Design

We have found 4 interesting designs on web based on looks, size, and how easy it is to build.

which are in detail in [opensouce projects](opensouce%20projects.md)

we finalised the [Educative 6 Axis Robot Arm](Educative%206%20Axis%20Robot%20Arm.md) project because :

- All the Materials very accessible
- Can be build with in Rs.30000 easily
- Complex in design
- less number of parts
- Small in size
- prebuild control software ready to use
- No need of any specific motors

# Intro


A robotic arm is a type of mechanical arm, usually programmable, with similar
functions to a human arm; the arm may be the sum total of the mechanism or may be part
of a more complex robot. The links of such a manipulator are connected by joints
allowing either rotational motion (such as in an articulated robot) or translational (linear)
displacement. The links of the manipulator can be considered to form a kinematic chain.
The terminus of the kinematic chain of the manipulator is called the end effector and it is
analogous to the human hand. The end effector, or robotic hand, can be designed to
perform any desired task such as welding, gripping, spinning etc., depending on the
application. For example robot arms in automotive assembly lines perform a variety of
tasks such as welding and parts rotation and placement during assembly. In some
circumstances, close emulation of the human hand is desired, as in robots designed to
conduct bomb disarmament and disposal.

While working in a fashion similar to the human arm, robot arms can still have a
much wider range of motion since their design can be purely up to the imagination of
their creator. The joint that connects the segments of a robotic arm, for example, can
rotate as well as moving like a hinge. The end of the robotic arm designed to actually do
the work that it was designed for is known as the end effector, and can be designed for
practically any task, for example gripping like a hand, painting, tightening screws and
more. These robots can be fixed in one place, for example along an assembly line, or they
can be mobile so they can be transported to do a variety of tasks in different places.

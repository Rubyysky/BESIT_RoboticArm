# Intro


Robotic arm we are making is desktop size Articulated robot with a gripper which can be used to handle very small loads, with 6 (Degree of freedom) DOF.The inspiration for making this robot is from Iron Man movie
this is mimature size robot arm which works same as real industrie robots used 
---

*Now a day robots are used for all kinds of work form cleaning to high precision cutting in industries as well as in small scale industries*

This robot is a mechanical arm, a manipulator designed to perform many different tasks and capable of repeated, variable programming. To perform its assigned tasks, the robot moves parts, objects, tools, and special devices by means of programmed motions and points. The robotic arm performs motions in space. Its function is to transfer objects or tools from point to point, as instructed by the controller In manufacturing industry and nuclear industry, a large fraction of the work is repetitive and judicious application of automation will most certainly result in optimum utilization of machine and manpower. A pneumatic `Pick and Place' Robot has been developed to achieve automation in applications where great sophistication is not needed and simple tasks like picking up of small parts at one location and placing them at another location can be done with great ease
